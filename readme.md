# Writing

Hey! This is a site or repository for my all writing, you can think of it like a blog. I've always wanted to get more into writing. I'm really obsessed with writing as an exercise for thought. It forces you to think linearly. It's a form of communication, and I love to think of communication as a way of teleporting one thought, idea, notion, nugget of information, from my brain to yours. I love thinking about how that thing, whatever you call it, has the ability to get lost in translation, or skew just a tad.

I'm employing myself to just do more, and stop waiting for a perfect solution for things. I hate mostly all blogging software that exists. I find it too cumbersome, to clunky, and downright inelegant. For some strange reason I love the way that Github treats files, so I'm using Github itself as my blogging platform and for now the delivery view port, the platter so-to-speak. This is interesting because there are a handful of advantages, here's a couple. I get to use issues as a comments or discussion board. I'm not the best writer so I can receive pull-requests from my friends and peers with typo edits. I can have both written date and publish-date or commit date. The best thing of all? I get to use Github!!!
