Today I attended a class at The Museum of Modern Art, led by Michael Mandiberg. The course was titled [Creative Appropriation](http://moma.org/learn/courses/courses#course236), some of the details are [on the MoMA Learning site](http://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/blog/creative-appropriation-the-smallest-move-is-often-the-hardest). When I signed up for the class I really had no clue what "Creative Appropriation" or "Art Appropriation" really meant. I had a hunch it had to do with the notions of copying, borrowing, remixing, and sampling, things like that.

First off the class was held in the beautiful eduction building right down the block from the actual museum, it's the one with the red formula-one race on the wall, yeah it's pretty awesome. We all arrive in a class room, we go around the room and all give introductions, a nice way to meet everyone and see where what everyones interests were. From there, we quickly head over to the other building to check out some art.

We started in room with post-impressionist art. To give some perspective we were standing in front of , you know the painting with all the swirls by Vincent van Gogh, no big deal. I'm kidding, it's a huge deal! It's like one of the most recognized paintings in the world!

We started in a big gallery space in a group standing across from one of Vincent van Gogh's iconic works ["The Starry Night"](http://www.moma.org/collection_images/resized/075/w500h420/CRI_133075.jpg). I've been in this room before, and every time I feel this sense of wonder. It's like waiting in line at a cafe when you notice theres a celebrity two people behind you, that your trying to get a peek at, but your being a giant weirdo. I'd argue it's even better than that! There are amazing works everywhere and and your encouraged to stare at the art! Seurat here, van Gogh their, a Rousseau creeps up behind you, then out of the corner of your eye a Picasso, it's all very intense. The name for all these types of works is ["post-imperssionist"](http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10173).

What dawned on me early in the day was an intense sense of scale that plays when it comes to art. A genre like post-impressionist puts a tag on a work. Most importantly it dates the work, which are important because it gives some insight on the status of the world at that time, creating a richer and fuller story about the work.

The significance of post-impressionism, was that it was the start of a fundamental shift in the way art was made. I never thought about the idea that before photography, art was about representing and capturing reality. Photography allowed for a "perfect" representation of realty. It's a scary and inspiring thought that one innovation or a small invention can have an effect on society, and artistic form. I never had the thought that something so seemingly innocent could change the function of art.

This notion that works of art are produced in a linear way, and reference past works and also reference the state of the world in which they were made is a really profound. It's like there's a string that ties every piece together. Each piece creates a story, and is an artifact left with intention. A story that can be traced back to the first cave paintings and handprints.

I've always seen a work of art as this self-contained object, but without context much of meaning is lost, and you're just left with a bunch of subjectively beautiful objects.

Going through the different galleries of the MoMA with a guide, someone who's explaining the context around the different works was immensely beneficial to my overall understanding of the works. This is very important, instead of hearing or reading about these strings that tie art together I was there, with the original works. This opportunity allowed me to sink into the physical space where they now reside, and in a way allowed me to be apart of this history of the work.

What I was most excited for was this bridging all of this history to the present moment. Really understanding how we got here. Everything led up to MoMA's _Sturtevant_ exhibit, which was really interesting, all pretty recent work that references all the classics. There was digital work as well, a series of televisions in the shape of an upside-down triangle of videos on a loop, as well as a video of someone playing pac-man. 

We went back to the classroom where we then explored some digital works. Within this realm I was reminded that the computer had the same effect on art that the camera did. Everyone in the class was shown how to make GIFs buy using online tools that convert youtube videos.
